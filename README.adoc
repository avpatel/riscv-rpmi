interface between application processors and platform microcontrollers for
management and control of system.

= Dependencies
The PDF built in this project uses AsciiDoctor (Ruby). For more information 
on AsciiDoctor, specification guidelines, or building locally, see the 
https://github.com/riscv/docs-dev-guide[RISC-V Documentation Developer Guide].

= Discussion Forum
Discussion on RPMI occurs on 
https://lists.riscv.org/g/tech-rpmi[RPMI mailing list].

https://github.com/riscv/docs-dev-guide[RISC-V Documentation Developer Guide].

= Build Documents
This project uses
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules[GitHub Submodules] to
include the RISC-V
https://github.com/riscv/docs-resources[docs-resources project] to achieve a
common look and feel.

When cloning this repository for the first time, you must either use
`git clone --recurse-submodules` or execute `git submodule init` and
`git submodule update` after the clone to populate the `docs-resources`
directory. Failure to clone the submodule, will result in the PDF build
fail with an error message.

The final specification in form of PDF and HTML can be generated using
`make` command. The `makefile` internally uses asciidoctor so the packages
required by the `makefile` need to be installed on the build system using
`make install-debs` or `make install-rpms`.

[,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-rpmi

git submodule init && git submodule update

make

= Editing Images
The source of all the images used in this specification is present in the
`images/source` folder. The source file is a single `drawio` format file
containing multiple tabs with chapter names. The source file can be opened
in the publicly available tool called *drawio-desktop* at this link:
