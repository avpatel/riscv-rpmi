== Transport
RPMI transport is the abstraction over a physical medium used to send and
receive messages between the application processor and the platform
microcontroller. 

An RPMI transport instance provides bi-directional communication channels
between a RISC-V privilege-level of an application processor and a platform
microcontroller. An application processor can have multiple RPMI transport
instances with a platform microcontroller. Similarly, a system can have multiple
platform microcontrollers each with its own RPMI transport instance to a set of
application processors. The <<fig_intro_trans_topology>> shows different RPMI
transport topologies.

This specification defines a shared memory based transport but other transport
types can be added in future.

An RPMI transport instance consists of two logical bi-directional channels for
message delivery. Each channel is capable to transfer messages in 
request-response pairs. A channel which transfers a request message from the
application processor to the platform microcontroller and its
response/acknowledgement back to the application processor is called an A2P
channel. Similarly, the channel for request messages from the platform
microcontroller to the application processor is called a P2A channel. The P2A
channel also transfers notification messages to the application processor.

An RPMI transport instance must implement the A2P channel. The P2A channel is
optional if the system does not support requests  and notification messages from
the platform microcontroller.

=== Shared Memory Transport
The physical memory of the RPMI shared memory transport can be either a
dedicated SRAM or a portion of DRAM or some other device memory. The RPMI
shared memory transport does not specify where the shared memory resides, but
it should be accessible from both the application processor and the platform
microcontroller with the necessary configurations to ensure that caching
side-effects do not occur.

NOTE: To avoid the caching side-effects, the platform can configure the shared
memory as IO or non-cacheable memory for both the application processor and the
platform microcontroller.

All the data sent or received through the RPMI shared memory transport follows
little-endian byte-order, unless, the byte-order is changed through hardware 
description mechanism.

The following sections describe the layout and attributes of shared memory
which should be consistent across both the application processor and the
platform microcontroller. These attributes may be static for the platform
microcontroller and discoverable by the application processor through supported
hardware description mechanisms.

==== Shared Memory Queues
The RPMI shared memory based transport consists of four queues where each queue
is unidirectional. The type of message and the direction of message delivery is
fixed for each queue.

.Shared Memory Transport Queues
[cols="2,6,8a", width=100%, align="center", options="header"]
|===
| Name	
| Message Type		
| Description

| A2P REQ
| REQUEST
| The request message queue from the application processor to the platform
microcontroller.

| P2A ACK
| ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
| The acknowledgement message queue from the platform microcontroller to the
application processor.

| P2A REQ
| REQUEST & NOTIFICATION
| The request message queue from the platform microcontroller to the application
processor. This queue is also used for sending the notification messages.

| A2P ACK
| ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
| The acknowledgement message queue from the application processor to the
platform microcontroller.

|===

The A2P REQ queue is paired with P2A ACK to form a channel. Similarly, the
P2A REQ is paired with A2P ACK queue to form another channel.

==== Layout of Transport Shared Memory
An RPMI transport instance requires four shared memory regions for four queues.
Each channel, A2P and P2A gets two memory regions respectively for REQ-ACK
queue pair. In each channel, both the REQ and ACK queue shared memory regions
must be of the same size to have equal number of slots count(queue capacity).
The shared memory regions size (or queue capacity) between A2P and P2A channel
can be different. For each queue the shared memory region size must be a multiple
of the slot size. Refer <<Queue Layout>> section for details and requirements
on queue internals and slots.

NOTE: A platform must reserve queue shared memory region sizes in each channel
such that the number of slots (queue capacity) does not become a bottleneck in
message communication. The number of slots in an A2P channel can be a function of
the number of application processors sharing the that transport instance and the
number of RPMI clients actively requesting service from the platform
microcontroller via messaging on a application processor.

NOTE: A platform may allocate separate non-contiguous shared memory regions for
queues which may require multiple PMA entries to define the memory attributes.
To avoid this the platform can allocate contiguous regions for all four queues.
For example, the platform may allocate `4096-byte` (Page) of shared memory for
all the four queues and memory attributes can be covered with single PMA entry.

.Memory Layout of Shared Memory

==== Queue Layout
A shared memory region representing a single queue is further divided into
a contiguous `M` number of equal size slots. The arrangement of slots is used
as a circular queue by the RPMI transport implementation.

Each slot size is `power-of-2` and at least `64-byte`. Each slot must be
aligned at a natural boundary. In each queue shared memory starting from offset
`0x0`, the first two slots are used to store head and tail for queue
management. The rest of the `(M-2)` slots are message slots. The first
`4-byte` of the first slot are used as head and the first `4-byte` of the
second slot are used as tail for enqueuing and dequeuing of messages.

.Queue Internals
image::queue-internals.png[500,500, align="center"]

The queue slots are assigned indices starting with `0`, which increases
sequentially. The slot with index `0` slot is the first message slot just after
the tail slot. The slots can be accessed using head and tail, which store
the slot indices. Head is be used to dequeue the message and tail is used to
enqueue the message.

The ownership of head and tail is mutually exclusive and only the owner is
allowed to write to it. For example, on the A2P REQ queue, the application
processor will enqueue the message and it will own the tail and only it will be
allowed to write to the tail, similarly, the platform microcontroller will own 
the head to dequeue the messages and only the platform
microcontroller will write to the head. Such restrictions are not applicable
in case of reading of head and tail.

NOTE: The arrangement of slot indices and ownership of head and tail is
necessary to make sure that the RPMI implementation on the application processor
does not conflict with the implementation of the platform microcontroller.

Messages which are not consumed yet should not be overwritten and the enqueue
operation must be blocked until the slot is available for sending messages.

[NOTE]
====
The requirement of minimum slot size of `64-byte` and keeping head and tail in
separate slots is because that usual CPU cache line size is of `64-byte`. This
may prevent both head and tail to share same cache line preventing any undefined
behavior. It's possible that the platform microcontroller may belong in
non-coherent domain and if the head and tail share same cache line and the
platform microcontroller is responsible to write to `TAIL` then the platform 
microcontroller will need to flush the cache with each write to make sure that
updated copy of tail is being read by the application processor.

The slot size of `64-byte` is also sufficient to accommodate most of the defined
RPMI services.
====

==== Shared Memory Representation in Firmware
The queue `slot-size` and queue shared memory region `base-address` and `size`
in bytes can be discovered through supported hardware description mechanism.

Total number of slots in each queue can easily be calculated by implementation
which is same for all four queues.

[NOTE]
====
```
Example calculation

X bytes : Queue shared memory size.
M = (X / slot-size) : Total slot count in a queue
(M-2) : Message slot count (2 slots less for `HEAD` and `TAIL`)
```
====

=== Doorbell Interrupt
An RPMI transport may also provide doorbell interrupts to either application
processor or platform microcontroller or both to signal the arrival of new
messages. The doorbell mechanism is optional for RPMI transport and
implementations an always use a polling mechanism for checking the arrival of
messages.

==== A2P Doorbell
The doorbell interrupts from the application processor to the platform
microcontroller can be either a message-signaled interrupt (MSI) or a wired
interrupt. If a doorbell is available then it must be supported through a
read-modify-write sequence to a memory-mapped register.
This read-modify-write mechanism can be discovered by the application processor
through the hardware description mechanisms using properties such as 
register physical address, register width, set mask, and preserve mask.

==== P2A Doorbell
The doorbell interrupts from the platform microcontroller to the application
processor can be either a message-signaled interrupt (MSI) or a wired interrupt.
If the doorbell interrupt from the platform microcontroller to the application
processor is a wired interrupt then the RPMI transport must define a way to
trigger the interrupt. If the doorbell interrupt is a MSI then a RPMI message
defined in the `BASE` service group can be used by the application processor to
configure the MSI at the platform microcontroller side.

=== Fast-channels
Fast-channels are shared memory based channel per application processor
required for use cases that require lower latency and faster processing
of commands. A Fast-channel layout and message format are specific to
service groups and not all service group needs to support these. A service
group that supports fast-channels may only enable some services to be used
over fast-channels.

NOTE: To avoid the caching side-effects, the platform can configure the shared
memory as IO or non-cacheable memory for both the application processor and the
platform microcontroller.

If the support for fast-channels is defined by a service group, its implementation
and attributes like physical memory address are discovered dynamically through
service defined by that particular service group.

Fast-channels may support doorbells but its optional. Attributes of doorbell
if supported are discovered dynamically via a service defined by the service group.
