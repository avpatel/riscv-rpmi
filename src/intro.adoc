== Introduction
Today's platforms pose challenges in terms of manageability and controllability,
where the operating system (OS) needs to support a variety of hardware with
a variety of connected devices. The extra complexity and demand to manage and
control the platform along with executing sophisticated workloads is a challenge
for the application processors (APs) running a general purpose OS. To address
this challenge, platforms today contain one or more microcontrollers which can
offload various platform management and control tasks.

This document describes the RISC-V Platform Management Interface (RPMI), which
is an OS-agnostic, firmware-agnostic, scalable and extensible interface for
platform management and control from dedicated microcontrollers (also referred
to as platform microcontroller or PuC).

The RPMI defines a message based communication between multiple application
processors (APs) and platform microcontrollers (PuCs) for system management
and control. This message based communication can also be virtualized by the
machine-mode firmware or hypervisors using the SBI MPXY extension cite:[SBI].

All RPMI capabilities and services provided by platform microcontroller are
discoverable at runtime which allows adding new capabilities and services
in the future.

=== RPMI Abstractions
*RPMI Transport*: An RPMI transport represents the mechanism by which the
messages are exchanged between the application processor and the platform
microcontroller. An RPMI transport instance is associated to a particular
RISC-V privilege level of the application processors and it must be accessed
only by that RISC-V privilege level.

*RPMI Messaging Protocol*: The RPMI messaging protocol defines different
types of RPMI messages and the format for each RPMI message type.

*RPMI Service Groups*: The services provided by the platform microcontrollers
to the application processors are grouped into RPMI service groups based on
functionality. Each RPMI service group specifies the RISC-V privilege levels
from which the application processor can access it. Platform vendors can
implement custom RPMI service groups.

*RPMI Client*: An RPMI client is a software or a driver running on the
application processor which is capable of sending and receiving RPMI messages.

*RPMI Context*: An RPMI context consists of an RPMI transport instance, RPMI
message protocol layer, a mandatory RPMI BASE service group and other optional
RPMI service groups. An RPMI context is associated with a RISC-V privilege level
which matches the included RPMI transport instance. The RPMI service groups
included in an RPMI context must be accessible from the RISC-V privilege level
associated with that RPMI context.

The RPMI is designed to work with a single or multi-tenant topology as shown
in the <<fig_intro_trans_topology>> below whereas the high-level architecture
is shown in the <<fig_intro_high_level_arch>> below.
